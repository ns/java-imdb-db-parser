== Java IMDB DB Parser

This Java based parser outputs XML files based on IMDB plain text data files available at http://www.imdb.com/interfaces

== Compile

You'll need to edit Main.java and decide on what you want to output, movies.xml, actors.xml, or actresses.xml. Comment out the other parse lines and output lines.

javac *.java

== Run

You'll need to set a high memory ceiling while the data is loaded into memory. I used something like this:

java -Xms500m -Xmx3g test
